5️⃣ Importing the Collection into Postman
Open Postman → click Import → Raw Text.
Paste the JSON from the file 
rks_api.postman_collection.json
 (generated in the repo).
The collection “RKS Business API” will appear with all endpoints pre‑filled.
Create a Postman Environment named RKS and add a variable:
Key: baseUrl
Value: https://rksapp.onrender.com/api (or whatever you have in 
.env.production
).
Select the environment when running requests.
The collection file is located at:

/home/redblox009/Projects/Radhakrishnan/rks/rks_api.postman_collection.json
You can also open the human‑readable guide you just received at:

/home/redblox009/Projects/Radhakrishnan/rks/API_POSTMAN_DOC.md
6️⃣ Quick Checklist
 Verify VITE_API_URL in 
.env.production
 matches the URL you’ll use in Postman.
 Import the Postman collection (
rks_api.postman_collection.json
).
 Set the baseUrl environment variable.
 Run a GET on each endpoint to confirm connectivity.
 Use the sample bodies above for POST requests, adjusting IDs/dates as needed.
7️⃣ Bonus: Ready‑to‑Run Bash Script (Optional)
If you prefer a quick CLI sanity‑check, you can run the script test_api.sh (generated earlier) which hits every endpoint and prints formatted output.

bash
chmod +x test_api.sh
source .env.production   # loads VITE_API_URL into the shell
./test_api.sh
You’re all set! 🎉 Use the guide and collection to fully exercise every API route, validate responses, and debug any issues. If anything else comes up—CORS, auth, or new endpoints—just let me know. Happy testing!

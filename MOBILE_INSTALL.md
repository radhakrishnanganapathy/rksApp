## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If the URL doesn't work:**
1. Make sure both devices are on the same WiFi
2. Check if your computer's firewall is blocking port 5173
3. Try the localhost URL if you're testing on the same device: `http://localhost:5173/`

**Alternative: Use QR Code**
- I can generate a QR code for easy access if needed

## 📝 Note
- The app will work as long as the development server is running on this computer
- For permanent deployment (so it works without this computer), let me know and I can help you deploy to Vercel or Netlify for free!

Enjoy your Business Management App! 🎉
